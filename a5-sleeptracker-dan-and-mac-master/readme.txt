4. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No there is not.


--Aim for no more than a few sentences for each of the following questions.--


5. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom? Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
We designed this app while thinking about users that use it before they sleep. We thought about the color and how it should be darker
to match the theme of night time. We did not think about which platform specifically, but since our users we kept in mind usually had iPhones,
we thought about iOS, but we designed for both.


6. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A person can log overnight sleep in the app by clicking on "Log Overnight Sleep." We chose to support it this way because
we wanted users to have the different options to choose from when they are in the main menu.


7. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A person can log overnight sleep in the app by clicking on "Log Daytime Sleepiness" in the main menu. We chose to support it this way because
we wanted users to have different options to choose from when they are in the main menu.


8. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
Just like the other two buttons, users can click on "View Logged Data" in the main menu. We chose to support viewing logged data this way because
we want to include all the options in the main menu so its easier to navigate around.


9. Which feature did you add for A5--using a native device resource, backing up logged data to Firebase, or both? If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
We implemented databases using logged data to Firebase which logs the users data without erasing them when the user closes the app.


10. Did you add any "extra" features, such as other data to log, changes to the styling of the app? If so, what did you add? How do these add to the experience of the app?
Yes, after A4, we added some extra features like a different styling within the app. The background, buttons, and tabs are all different colors with a nice grey gradient on the home page. Along 
with changing the center of the time and color.
